    <p><em>Spaghetti Carbonara</em> or simply <em>Carbonara</em> is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with eggs, hard cheese, cured pork, and black pepper. </p>
    <p>The dish arrived at its modern form, with its current name, in the middle of the 20th century.</p>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>12 slices thick-cut, applewood-smoked bacon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup dry vermouth</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup whipping cream (Optional)</li>
        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Step by Step:</p>
    <ol>
       <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li>
       <li>Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
       <li>Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet and discard the rest. Chop bacon when cool enough to handle.</li>
       <li>Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour vermouth into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, about 1 minute. </li>
       <li>Mix in chopped bacon!</li>
       <li>Drain spaghetti, transfer to a large serving bowl, and mix in remaining 1 tablespoon oil. </li>
       <li>Add bacon-onion mixture, Parmesan cheese, cream, eggs, and pepper to the hot pasta; stir until spaghetti is well coated and sauce is creamy.</li>
    </ol>
